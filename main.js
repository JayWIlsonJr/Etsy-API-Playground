Our bodysuits are 100% ringspun cotton. Ringspun cotton goes through a process which spins the cotton creating a softer and more durable texture. Other reasons have gone into our choices.\r\n\r\n* Cotton is a natural fabric and non allergenic.\r\n* Cotton does not release small particulate matter as blends do, therefore are perfect for babies that suffer from asthma or other allergies.\r\n* Synthetic blends are often treated with chemicals to give them their finish. These chemicals can cause rashes on the delicate skin of a baby.\r\n* Because cotton is natural, it is breathable and cooler for your baby.\r\n\r\nOur baby bodysuits have 3 snaps at the bottom to make diaper change a breeze. Also perfect for keeping those tiny tummies covered up!
